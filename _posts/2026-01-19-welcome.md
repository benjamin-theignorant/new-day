This is my first post on my new GitHub-hosted blog!

I decided to move away from platforms that control my data. By using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, I have full control over the design and my audience.

Why this setup?

Speed: It's a static site, so it loads instantly.

Markdown: I can write in any text editor.

Free: No monthly subscription fees.

Thanks for reading!
